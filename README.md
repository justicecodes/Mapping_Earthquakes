# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey to create earthquake maps that are informative and easy to used. The earthquake data is represented on the maps, color-coded by magnitude and showing the relation of the earthquake locations to the tectonic plate lines across the world.
